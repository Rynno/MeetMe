# MeetMe Planner  - Android 
Many people use Doodle and similar services to find times to meet. 
When the number of participants is more than three or four, this usually leads to one of two scenarios:
A poll is distributed with a few proposed meeting times. 

Each prospective participant has conflicts with at least one of the proposed times. A flurry of email follows, then either a new poll is distributed with agreed candidate times, or else the meeting time is just settled by email. 
To avoid the first scenario, a poll is distributed with many time slots. 
It is tedious to fill out, but at least it is possible to find an acceptable meeting time in a single round. 
To avoid both of these scenarios, we need a meeting time arranger that can start with plausible meeting times, based on the schedules of prospective participants. 
To find plausible meeting times, the meeting planner should draw from participants' calendars and possibly other sources of information. 
Drawing data from a person's calendar or schedule entails dealing properly with issues of privacy, confidentiality, and security.
